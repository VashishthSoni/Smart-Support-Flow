Automated Ticketing &amp; SLA Escalation System

I built a fully automated support ticket system that handles incoming emails, creates tickets, tracks SLA deadlines, sends follow-up nudges, escalates overdue requests, and generates weekly performance reports. All without human input.

Designed for small businesses and agencies that rely on Gmail for support, this automation saves up to 65% of time, prevents missed tickets, and ensures faster response times with no extra tools required.
